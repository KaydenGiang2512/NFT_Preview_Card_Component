## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Div overlaying using position absolute
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This challenge was a great refresher for me on simple front-end concepts, nothing too fancy or complicated involved within the codebase. Just pure CSS3 at work! The only challenging aspect I could think of for this project was the overlay display on hover, which I haven't done in quite some time so my working process wasn't exactly as smooth as I had hoped.

### Continued development

I don't think I will be doing any more development on this project given its scope. Probably be looking into more difficult challenges in the future.
